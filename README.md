## Model Providers

This template ships with OpenAI `gpt-4-1106-preview` as the default. However, thanks to the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), or using [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com) with just a few lines of code.

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
